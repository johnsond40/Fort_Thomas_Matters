        <h1>Basic Solution Outline</h1>
        <p>The first step to survival would be to hoard all of the pretzels, peanuts, soda, and water to yourself. Make trades with the other survivors with useless items, such as the pillows, blankets, or bottle opener. Once you have all the food and water, see if you can negotiate for the pocket knife as well. It'll come in handy later!
        </p>
        <p>Your next step is to establish a home base where you can defend your supplies. People can turn into animals in an extreme survival situation, so make sure you're prepared to defend yourself. If anyone does attempt to steal your stuff, show no mercy to prove your authority as the leader of this group of survivors.</p>
        <p>Once the other survivors respect you and pay you the proper tribute, use the magnetic compass to begin walking north until you come upon civilization and survive! Alternatively, you could stay in one spot using the matches to burn the blankets for warmth and use the signal flares whenever someone passes for rescue. Either way, you're sure to make it home safe!</p>
